# News API

## Background

My first API project created at Northcoders.

## To-do

1. Fork this repo

2. Clone your forked repo by pasting this in your terminal:

3. Install dependencies and devDependencies by running 'npm install' in your terminal. These are all already in the package.json file.

4. In the root folder, please create two .env files that Dotenv will use to connect to the appropriate database. The .env-example file in this repository provides the format you should use when filling in the details for these two files. It is important to ensure that the names of the databases are correctly specified in their respective .env files. Name the two .env files as follows:

- .env.test
- .env.development
